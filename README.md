# On the Importance of Considering Non-Human Errors in Machine Learning
_by Marina Est√©vez-Almenzar and Ricardo Baeza-Yates_

In this repository we release a simple notebook with all the calculations we made in the paper _On the Importance of Considering Non-Human Errors in Machine Learning_.
We hope that those who are interested in exploring non-human errors find this notebook useful.
