# The Relevance of Non-Human Errors in Machine Learning
_by Marina Est√©vez-Almenzar and Ricardo Baeza-Yates_

In this repository we release a simple notebook with all the calculations we made in the paper _The Relevance of Considering Non-Human Errors in Machine Learning_.
We hope that those who are interested in exploring non-human errors find this notebook useful.

In this notebook we are customizing some functions from [Big Transfer (BiT): General Visual Representation Learning](https://github.com/google-research/big_transfer) (_by Alexander Kolesnikov, Lucas Beyer, Xiaohua Zhai, Joan Puigcerver, Jessica Yung, Sylvain Gelly, Neil Houlsby_) in order to focus on the errors made by the model.
